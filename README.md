# react-cypress-demo

# Overview
Demo of a simple React application that uses react-device-detect to display the name of the browser. Edge will display `Hello From Edge`, Chrome will say `Hello From Chrome`, etc. Then I ran Cypress tests that were testing against different browsers to make sure they displayed the correct text.

The goal here was to practice Cypress different browsers and testing frontends that need to support multiple browsers.
